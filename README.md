# RandomArt

## Description

this is a program to get a random piece of art from the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/).
It uses the [Metropolitan Museum of Art API](https://metmuseum.github.io/).
You can filter the art by date, and medium (painting, sculpture, etc) right now.

## Why?

I was taking an art history class and needed a way to get specific pieces of art for my work, and couldn't choose from the many many pieces of art on the website.
